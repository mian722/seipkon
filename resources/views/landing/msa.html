            any act or omission of any other person or entity. You or We will give Us or You notice and will
            use
            commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact of any such event.</p>
        <p>16.2. UNIQUE VALUE</p>
        <p>The Services and Platforms We provide pursuant to the User Licenses are of a special, unique,
            extraordinary and intellectual character which gives them a peculiar value, the loss of which
            cannot
            be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages in an action at law and which would cause Us
            irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly, We shall be entitled to injunctive relief and other
            equitable relief to preserve Our intellectual property rights and interest in and to such rights
            and
            Services as set forth herein. This provision shall not, however, be construed as a waiver of any
            rights We may have for damages or otherwise arising from any breach. Accordingly, You agree that
            You
            are solely responsible for (and that We have no responsibility to You or to any third party for)
            any
            claims, loss or damages arising out of or relating to any breach of Your obligations under this
            Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>16.3. ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that by submitting an electronic version of Your signature through an
            electronic signature program as a means of accepting this Agreement, You are submitting a
            legally
            binding electronic signature and are entering into a legally binding contract.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>16.4. FEEDBACK</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, reviews, suggestions, ideas and feedback
            related to the Services and provided to Us (collectively, &ldquo;Feedback&rdquo;) may be used or
            shared by Us internally to better serve You. We shall own exclusive rights to the Feedback,
            including
            all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and
            dissemination of
            Feedback for any purpose, excepting those uses and disseminations that violate Our Privacy
            Policy. You
            represent and warrant that: (a) such Feedback is non-confidential; (b) the Feedback is accurate
            and
            not misleading or harmful in any manner; and (c) the Feedback does not, and will not, violate
            this
            Agreement or any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>
        <p>16.5. ASSIGNMENT&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Neither You nor We may assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder
            without the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
            withheld;
            provided, however, either You or We may, upon notice to the other, assign this Agreement to a
            parent,
            subsidiary, division, affiliate, or successor upon the merger, consolidation, sale or transfer
            of all
            or substantially all assets, so long as Your or Our successor to such transaction assumes all of
            the
            obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the above restrictions, this Agreement shall be
            binding
            on and shall inure to the benefit of You or Us, and Our respective heirs, administrators,
            successors,
            and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You and We agree to permit automatic
            assignment
            in the instance of a &ldquo;change of control&rdquo; event.</p>
        <p>16.6. LANGUAGE OF THIS AGREEMENT</p>
        <p>If We have provided You with a translation of the English language version of this Agreement,
            then
            You agree that the translation is provided for Your convenience only and that the English
            language
            version of this Agreement will govern the relationship between You and Us.</p>
        <p>16.7. SEVERABILITY AND SURVIVABILITY</p>
        <p>If any provision or any portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
            unenforceable for any reason, such determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability
            of
            the remaining provisions hereof. The following sections will survive any termination of the
            Agreement:
            Ownership, Confidentiality, Pricing, Billing Practices and Payment, Representation and
            Warranties,
            Limitation of Liability and Indemnification.</p>

        <p>You consent to receiving electronic communications and agree that all agreements, notices,
            disclosures and other communications that We provide to You electronically, via email or by
            posting

            deemed delivered upon the earlier of the verification of delivery or two (2) business days after
            being
            sent.</p>
        <p>16.9.&nbsp;NO WAIVER</p>
        <p>Either Party&rsquo;s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a
            waiver
            of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision.</p>
        <p>16.10. CONTROLLING DOCUMENT AND ENTIRE AGREEMENT</p>
        <p>To the extent that anything is in conflict or inconsistent with this Agreement, this Agreement
            shall
            govern. This MSA, the Privacy Policy, together with all other documents that are expressly
            incorporated herein by reference, shall constitute the entire agreement between the Parties, and

            third
            party affiliates who utilize the Platforms, or any other party with whom You choose to engage to
            perform any transaction involving the Services. There are no third-party beneficiaries of this
            Agreement.</p>
